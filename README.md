  - Payce consumes data from the network to display comprehensive transaction history.  
  - Includes enriched transaction metadata for robust account statements.  

## Next Steps  

- **Embedded Wallet Integration**:  
  Implementing a custodial wallet infrastructure for Payce users to enhance accessibility and convenience.
- **AI Agent Integration**:  
  Integrating AI agents to completely automate all financial admin tasks and connect users to autonomous DeFi.

## Reown App Kit Integration

We use Reown's App Kit for seamless wallet connection and network validation. Here's how we utilize the key hooks:

```typescript
// Network Validation
const { caipNetwork } = useAppKitNetwork();
// Checks current network and ensures the user is on Solana

// Account Status
const { address, isConnected } = useAppKitAccount();
// Manages wallet connection state and user's address

// Connection Management
const { connection } = useAppKitConnection();
// Handles RPC connection to Solana network

// Wallet Provider
const { walletProvider } = useAppKitProvider<Provider>('solana');
// Provides Solana wallet interface for transactions
```
